1,What is this QnA App?,The QnA App is a RAG-powered question-and-answer service combining embedding-based retrieval with AI-generated responses.
2,How does the RAG retrieval work?,The app computes embeddings for FAQs and user queries, then uses cosine similarity to find the most relevant contexts before generating an answer.
3,Which AI models are used?,We use the OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 model for embeddings and gpt-4o for answer generation and summarization.
4,What is the summarize endpoint?,The /api/summarize endpoint refines AI-generated answers into concise summaries via a secondary summarization agent.
5,How is user history managed?,The app stores Q&A pairs in an in-memory history log accessible via /api/history; future versions will persist to a database.
6,Is there a Docker deployment option?,Docker support is planned: a docker-compose file will orchestrate backend and frontend containers for easy setup.
7,What future features are planned?,Upcoming features include user authentication, rate limiting, context validation UIs, and human-in-the-loop feedback.
8,Will there be support for multiple languages?,Multi-language question answering is on the roadmap, leveraging translation pre and post-processing layers.
9,Can I integrate this with other platforms?,Future releases will include a webhook-based API and SDKs for seamless integration into existing web and mobile apps.
10,How can I contribute or report issues?,The project will be open-sourced on GitHub, where you can submit pull requests, issues, and feature requests.
